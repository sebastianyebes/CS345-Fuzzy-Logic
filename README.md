## Robot Navigation Control ðŸ¤–
### 1. Inputs and Outputs for the FLC
#### **Inputs:**
- `Distance (m)` - the distance from the robot to an object
- `Angle (Î¸)` - the angle of motion of an object with respect to the robot
#### **Output:**
- `Deviation (Î´)` - the deviation with respect of the Distance and Angle

### 2.1 Fuzzy Membership Function for the Inputs
- Fuzzy Membership Functions for `Distance`

### 2.2 Fuzzy Membership Function for Output

- Fuzzy Membership Functions for Output `Deviation`

### 3. Fuzzy Rule Base for Output Deviation
Let Distance:
- VN: `Very Near` , NR: `Near` , FR: `Far` , VFR: `Very Far`

Let Angle:
- LT: `Left` , AL: `Ahead Left` , A: `Ahead` , AR: `Ahead Right` , RT: `Right`

| Distance â†“ Angle â†’ |   LT   |   AL   |   A    |   AR   |   RT   |
|:------------------:| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
|  **VN**            |   A    |   AR   |   AL   |   AL   |   A    |  
|  **NR**            |   A    |   A    |   RT   |   A    |   A    |    
|  **FR**            |   A    |   A    |   AR   |   A    |   A    |     
|  **VFR**           |   A    |   A    |   A    |   A    |   A    |
